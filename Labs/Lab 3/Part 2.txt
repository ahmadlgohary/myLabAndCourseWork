Can you explain why 3+5+8 divided by 3 doesn't give the correct average of the numbers 3, 5, and 8?
because it is dividing by an intger not a decimal number when dividing by integers the complier give answers to whole 
numbers and ignores remainders to get an accurate average divide by 3.0.


Using your text book, or an Internet search (do not ask friends or TA) or simply by experimenting with 
Geany, explain in a few sentences the differences between the division (/) and the remainder (%) operators.
(/) divides integers by intergers to give intgers. integers by doubles to give doubles but (%) divides integers by intergers 
and gives an integer and the remainder unlike (/) which only gives an integer.
