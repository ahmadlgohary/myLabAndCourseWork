/*
Exercise #6:

Answer these 10 questions by reading your notes, your textbook or by trying with Geany:

What is the difference between char and Char?

char is a variable type used to introduce variables where Char is not because C is cases sensitive 
Char and char are not the same thing CHar can be used as a varible name but char cannot.

What is displayed by printf ("%d", 3/4); ?

nothing

Is printf ("%f", 50); valid?

no because 50 is an integer and %f is for float or decimals

If you omit the ; at the end of a C statement, is it still working?

no because ; is delclaring that the commad is done and ready to be executed

What is the difference between %f and %lf?

%f is place holder for float and %lf is for long float which uses more memory than than float 

What happens when you attempt a division by zero in C?

you get a warning and it tells you dividing by zero is not possible

Is the expression 35%15.3 valid?

no it is missing the multipilcation sign * and % is not recoginsed as /100 by the compliler

Is there a difference between starting your program with main() instead of int main (void)?

yes the type specifier is missing

What happens if you try to display an integer between 0 and 255 with a %c placeholder?

the compiler doesnot recognise numbers as characters

Are the expressions 5/3, 5%3, 5.0/3 exactly the same?

5/3 and5.0/3 is the same thing but 5%3 is not because it is missing the multipilcation sign * and 
% is not recoginsed as /100 by the compliler and in general 5% of 3 is not equal to 5/3

/*
part II
explain in one or two sentences the difference between the printf and scanf statements in C.

scanf is to take a value from the user and assign it to a variable but printf is to show a message to the user for example  
to tell them what to input

explain in one sentence or two the difference between integer and double variables in C.

and integer is a whole number without decimals while a double can be a decimal or a whole number it doesnt matter to the compliler.
