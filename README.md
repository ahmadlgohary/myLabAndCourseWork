# myLabAndCourseWork
My University classwork and labs for coding and electronic classes from first year and second year (I will be uploading my third year ones at the end of each semester). This includes labs for the following courses:              
1. Digital Computation and Programming (CPS125)            
2. Electric Circuit Analysis (ELE202)            
3. Software Systems (COE318)            
4. Digital Systems (COE328)             
5. Electronic Systems (ELE302)          
6. Engineering Algorithms and Data Structures (COE428)        
7. Electronic Circuits I (ELE404) 
8. Object Oriented Eng Analysis and Design (COE528) 

In the near future I will be uploading the finished labs for the following courses (at the end of the semester by Christmas Break):            
1. Database Systems I (CPS510)           
2. Microprocessor Systems (COE538)        
3. Signals and Systems I (ELE532) [ This will also include some MATLAB codes from first year]
