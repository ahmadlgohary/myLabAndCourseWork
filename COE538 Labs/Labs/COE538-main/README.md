Assembly Code for all COE538 labs. 

Personally, I really liked this course. Unfortunately, I had to take this course online meaning that I could not do the labs in-person. 
The labs in-person are supposedly really fun because you basically program these microcontrollers for things like robots. 
Hopefully this repository is helpful to someone who can do these labs in-person, and I hope you have a lot of fun with them!
